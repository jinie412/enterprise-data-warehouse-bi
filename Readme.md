# Enterprise Data Warehouse & BI Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end **enterprise data warehouse and analytics pipeline** using airline operations data, focusing on data modeling, ETL, and business intelligence reporting.

---

## Architecture
CSV → SSIS → SQL Server (NDS → Star Schema) → SSAS (OLAP) → Power BI


---

## Key Components
- **Data Modeling:** Designed normalized (3NF) and dimensional (star schema) models for analytical workloads.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Built automated ETL workflows using **SSIS** to extract, cleanse, transform, and load CSV data into the data warehouse.
- **OLAP & Analytics:** Developed **SSAS OLAP cubes** to support multi-dimensional analysis across time, airlines, and airports.
- **Reporting:** Created interactive **Power BI dashboards** with KPIs such as on-time performance, delay rates, and cancellation trends.
